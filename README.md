The DriverPass project was designed for Liam, the owner of a company that helps students prepare for their driving tests. His goal was to create an online system that combines practice exams, study materials, and in-person driving lessons all in one place. The system also needed to let students schedule or cancel lessons, while giving staff and instructors tools to manage accounts, cars, and appointments. In short, DriverPass wanted something modern, easy to use, and secure so the company could run more smoothly and students could learn more efficiently.

One thing I feel I did particularly well was turning the client’s ideas from the interview into clear system requirements. I made sure to define what each user—like students, instructors, and admins—could do, and how security, scheduling, and DMV updates would work together. It was satisfying to see how the pieces connected to support both the business and the students’ needs.

If I could revise one area, I’d spend more time improving the reporting and analytics features. I’d like to include visual dashboards that show student progress, instructor schedules, and overall business performance in real time.

When designing the system, I focused heavily on what the users needed most—something simple, organized, and accessible from anywhere. I’ve learned that understanding users is one of the most important parts of system design. A system only works well when it truly supports the people who use it every day.

Going forward, I plan to use strategies like use-case analysis, prototyping, and feedback loops in future projects. These techniques make it easier to design systems that are both functional and user-friendly.
